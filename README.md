Machine Learning Prediction Model for survival of passengers

<b>RMS Titanic</b> was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single ship up to that time. It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship. (Wikipedia)

This is the submission for Titanic Machine Learning Task on Kaggle. This notebook analyses the titanic dataset of passengers and looks at the accuracy score of different models for classificaton of survival of passengers selecting the best model for predicting the survival.
